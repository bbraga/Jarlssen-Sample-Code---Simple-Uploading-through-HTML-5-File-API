This package contains a sample application I did for Jarlssen as a followup to an Interview Task.

Task:

	Please make a running prototype of a web upload form to validate a file before uploading it completly to the server. Check if the file size is greater than a given max size and check if file type is an image or pdf. This all is useful, if the file size is huge.

	Some hints for you:
		- you can use the javascript FILE API
		- please do not use jquery for this
		- please use PHP as serverside scripting language
